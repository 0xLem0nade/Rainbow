This script will deploy Docker containers of TLS-based proxies
such as [VLESS, VMESS, Trojan, Hysteria, MTProto] hence it requires
the following in order to proceed:

1. A domain name added to your Cloudflare account

2. CDN proxy MUST BE OFF WHILE DEPLOYING! You can turn it on after finishing the setup.

3. Based on your selected proxies, you will need a few
    subdomains with 'A' records pointed to your origin server:

    (A). A subdomain to use for protocols that require a direct connection
        to your server such as [VLESS(TCP), VMESS(HTTP), Hysteria]

    (B). A subdomain to use for protocols that are compatible with CDNs
        such as [Websocket, gRPC], this way you can turn on CDN routing
        for these protocols when your IP is blocked!

    (C). A subdomain for DNS-over-HTTPS/TLS server, this will help
        encrypt your DNS requests and also block certain ccTLDs
        such as [.ir] and [.cn] therefore further protecting your server
        from detection and probing

    (D). A subdomain for MTProto proxy

4. A Cloudflare API key that has permission to modify DNS zones
